    <h1> Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with properties, compostion and behavior of matter. It is a fascinating field that explores the building block of the universe.</p>
    <h2> Chemical Elements </h2>
    <p>The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.</p>
    <h3>Chemical equations</h3>
    <p> Chemical reactions are represented using chemical equations. Here's an example of a chemical reaction.</p>
    <p><b>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> â†’ 2H<sub>2</sub>O</b></p>
    <p>The equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas(H<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen gas(O<sub>2</sub>) to form water(H<sub>2</sub>O). <p>
    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    <p>Stoichiometry is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions> It involves balancing chemical equation to ensure mass and chage are conserved.</p>
    <p><sub>Subscripts </sub>indicate the number of atoms of eac element in a molecule, while <sup>Superscripts</sup> represent charge or the number of atoms in an ion.</p>
    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understandig the world around us. From the compositon of the air we breath to the ractions that power our bodies. CHemistry influences every aspect of our lives.</p>
